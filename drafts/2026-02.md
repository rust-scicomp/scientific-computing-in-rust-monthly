# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #15

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).

## Crate of the month: approx
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/approx) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/approx/latest/approx/) ~ [source](https://github.com/brendanzab/approx)

approx is a really useful crate for whenever you're writing unit tests for scientific code, as it contains helpful macros like
`assert_relative_eq` that check if two items are equal within a given tolerance. If you like the approx crate, keep reading, as there's
an opportunity to help with its maintenance in the "help wanted" section below.

## New releases

### [Polyfit 0.10.1](https://crates.io/crates/polyfit)
Polyfit is a high-performance, easy-to-use polynomial fitting library for Rust, designed to make curve fitting accessible to software engineers without a background in statistics.
It is generic over data type, as well as 11 choices of basis. It supports symbolic calculus, root-finding, and a spectral energy filter for orthogonal bases. It is high-performance, able to perform a 100-million-row 3rd-degree Chebyshev fit in ~1s on moderate consumer hardware.

## Help wanted

### [approx `0.6.0`](https://github.com/brendanzab/approx)
The [approx](https://crates.io/crates/approx) crate is planning a new release `0.6.0` with a large set of new features.
This update contains many improvements such as derive macros and additional implementations for core and external types (i.e. `Option<T>`, `OrderedFloat<F>` etc.).
Due to the amount of additions, we are hoping for testers of the release candidates `0.6.0-rc2` and following before releasing `0.6.0` into the wild.
