# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #14

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

<!-- Editor can write a 2-3 sentence introduction here -->

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items
[here](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly#contributing-an-item).

## Crate of the month: measurements
<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.
If you'd like to suggest a crate that we could include here, tell us on the rust-scicomp Zulip chat
(https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/login/).
-->
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/measurements) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/measurements/0.11.1/measurements/) ~ [source](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/rust-measurements)

The `measurements` crate allows you to represent physical quantities. You can get your quantities in different, compatible units and perform arithmetic operations. `measurements` is `no-std` compatible. Thus, you can even use proper units in your embedded projects! This crate has a small footprint and is highly useful to avoid common errors of, e.g., forgetting unit conversions, which can be very costly (e.g., [Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter)).


## New releases
<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->
### [Bevy 0.18.0](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)
Bevy is a data-driven game engine built in Rust. This release includes numerous new features, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements. A detailed blog post can be found [here](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-18/).

### [Burn 0.20.0](https://crates.io/crates/burn)
Burn is a tensor library and deep learning framework optimized for numerical computing,m model interference, and model training. This release features major performance improvements thanks to the introduction of [CubeK](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubek/). 

### [InterpN 0.11.0](https://crates.io/crates/interpn)
InterpN is an n-dimensional interpolation/extrapolation methods library that is `no-std` compatible. This release provides some behind-the-scenes improvements. Notably, all methods are now compatible with static analysis of memory usage and early bounds checks were improved.

### [rlst 0.6.1](https://crates.io/crates/rlst)
The Rust Linear Solver Toolbox `rlst` provides dense and sparse linear algebra routines in Rust. Since the last newsletter, version 0.5 and 0.6 have been released, adding various methods, functions, and interfaces. Details can be found in the release notes [here](https://codeberg.org/rlst/rlst/releases).

## Events
<!--
This section can be used to advertise events. Items should be sorted in date order, with
sooner events first, and should use the format:

### [<event name>, <day-day month year>, <location or "held virutally">, <date>](<website URL>)
<brief description of event>
-->

## Publications
<!--
This section can be used to publicise papers, articles and blog posts published about scientific computing in Rust.
Items should be sorted in the alphabetical order of the surname of the first listed author.
Papers posted should use the following format:

### [<authors>, <title>, <journal> <volume>](<DOI>)
<brief description of paper>

Other publications should use the following format:

### [<author>, <title>](<link>)
<brief description>
-->

### [Irving B., et al., Mantaray: A Rust Package for Ray Tracing Ocean Surface Gravity Waves](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.08691)

Mantaray is a open-source Rust package with a Python interface that solves the ray equations for ocean surface gravity waves. It is designed for performance, robustness, and ease of use. Mantaray can currently be applied to idealized and realistic wave propagation problems.

### [Wenger, A. (@fasterthanlime), The science of loudness](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-science-of-loudness)

In this blog post, Amos walks the reader through the physics of the science of sound, loudness, noise, and the associated units. The follow up article [Making our own spectrogram](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/making-our-own-spectrogram) builds on this and shows how to make a spectrogram in Rust. This is a very accessible introduction and contains many fun animations and code snippets.

## Jobs
<!--
This section can be used to advertise jobs that may be of interest. Items should be sorted in the
order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<job title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of job, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Studentships
<!--
This section can be used to advertise studentships (eg PhDs, Master's programmes) that may be of interest.
Items should be sorted in the order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of studentship, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Help wanted
<!--
If you're looking for people to help develop or maintain a project, you can add it here. Items here
should be sorted in alphabetical order by project name and use the format:

### [<library name>](<link to source code repository>)
<brief description of the library and what kind of help you're interested in>
-->
### [Goombay-rs](https://github.com/lignum-vitae/goombay-rs)

Goombay-rs is the Rust implementation of my [Goombay](https://github.com/lignum-vitae/goombay) library. Goombay is a sequence alignment library with over 20 algorithms written entirely in python. My initial goal with Goombay-rs is to implement the algorithms that are present in the python version of the library. The secondary goal of the library would be to speed up computation time where possible while still maintaining the core fundamentals of each algorithm. A tertiary goal of the project is to include the abilitly to `pip install` the project to be used in Python. [Spindalis](https://github.com/lignum-vitae/spindalis/issues) (which also has open issues) is the primary dependency for Goombay-rs used for matrix manipulation.

## Miscellaneous
<!--
Any items that do not fit into any other section can be added here.
-->

### [CocoIndex](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex)
An open-source, data transformation framework with its core engine written in Rust, designed for building and maintaining continuously updated indexes over large datasets. CocoIndex supports incremental processing and provides data lineage tracking, making it well-suited for scientific workflows involving evolving research data. Potential applications include [indexing academic papers with structured metadata extraction](https://cocoindex.io/blogs/academic-papers-indexing), building knowledge graphs from research outputs, and creating semantic search capabilities over scientific literature. The framework uses a dataflow programming model and integrates with various databases including PostgreSQL and vector databases for semantic search applications.
