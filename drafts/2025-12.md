## Crate of the month: CRATE-NAME

<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.

## New releases

<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [ferreus_bbfmm 0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/ferreus_bbfmm)
`ferreus_bbfmm` is a parallel implementation of the Black Box Fast Multipole Method (BBFMM). BBFMM is a kernel‑independent, 
hierarchical algorithm for rapidly evaluating all pairwise interactions in a collection of particles.

While originally developed as the fast evaluator for [radial basis function (RBF) interpolation](https://docs.rs/ferreus_rbf/latest/ferreus_rbf/), 
this crate has been generalised to support a broad range of FMM use‑cases where the kernel is smooth (i.e. non‑oscillatory).

Features
- 1D (binary tree), 2D (quadtree) and 3D (octree) trees
- Optimised low‑rank M2L interactions that leverage symmetries and compression
- Adaptive and non‑adaptive tree structures
- Support for multiple right‑hand sides
- Designed to work with user‑defined kernels via traits
- Built on [faer](https://docs.rs/faer/latest/faer/) for linear algebra, avoiding complex external dependencies
- Python [bindings](https://pypi.org/project/ferreus-bbfmm/) and [docs](https://graphic-goose.github.io/ferreus_rbf_rs/ferreus_bbfmm/) available

### [ferreus_rbf 0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/ferreus_rbf)
`ferreus_rbf` is a fast, memory-efficient, global radial basis function (RBF) interpolation crate written in Rust.

Direct RBF solvers based on dense linear algebra require O(N²) memory and O(N³) work, which quickly becomes impractical
beyond tens of thousands of points. `ferreus_rbf` provides a scalable alternative suitable for millions of points in up
to three dimensions.

Features
- Supports 1D, 2D and 3D input domains
- Scales to datasets with over 1,000,000 source points (subject to hardware)
- Optional global trend transforms to capture large‑scale structure in the data
- Fast 3D isosurface extraction using a surface‑following, non‑adaptive Surface Nets method
- Built on [faer](https://docs.rs/faer/latest/faer/) for linear algebra, avoiding complex external dependencies
- Python [bindings](https://pypi.org/project/ferreus-rbf/) and [docs](https://graphic-goose.github.io/ferreus_rbf_rs/ferreus_rbf/) available

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->
### [crate2bib 0.7](https://crates.io/crates/crate2bib)
Convert a given crate and (optional) version number to a BibLaTeX entry.
It scans for existing CITATION.cff files within the repository and also generates entries from the information available at crates.io.
The tool can be used as a [webapp](https://jonaspleyer.github.io/crate2bib/), [python package](https://pypi.org/project/crate2bib/), [command-line utility](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/crate2bib/tree/main/crate2bib-cli) or [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crate2bib) (see also [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.07468)).

### [rsl-interpolation v0.1.16](https://crates.io/crates/rsl-interpolation)
A re-write of [`GSL's Interpolation`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/interp.html) in Rust, a library for interpolating over 1D and 2D arrays, with 1st, 2nd and mixed 
derivative calculation and 1D numerical integration.

Implemented features:

- 'Linear', 'Cubic', 'Akima', 'Akima Periodic' and 'Steffen' 1D interpolation types
- 'Bilinear' and 'Bicubic' 2D interpolation types.
- [`Index look-up Acceleration`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/interp.html#d-index-look-up-and-acceleration)
- Low level interface (interpolation functions)
- High level interface (splines)

All of GSL's tests have been transferred, and new ones have been added with values calculated directly from GSL's routines,
ensuring that the results are in agreement with GSL to machine precision.

### [DeepCausality 0.12](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality)

DeepCausality started out as a project in advanced computational causality for static and dynamic multimodal causal models, but its most recent release contains [a new foundation](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-causal-monad/) that comes combined with [multiple unified math libraries](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-uniform-math/) for:

* Geometric Algebra
* Differential Topology
* Sparse Matrix representation
* Tensor Operations including ein_sum

Geometry, topology, sparse matrices, and tensor operations seamlessly compose with each other and thus form the foundation of the [new physics crate](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-physics-crate/), a pure Rust implementation of physics formulas across different fields, such as:

* Astrophysics: Astrophysics kernels (Schwarzschild radius, orbital velocity, luminosity, Hubble's law, etc.).
* Dynamics: Classical mechanics (Kinematics, Newton's laws), state estimation (Kalman filters), and Euler integration.
* Electromagnetism: Maxwell's equations, Lorentz force, Poynting vectors, and gauge fields using Geometric Algebra.
* Fluids: Fluid dynamics (Bernoulli's principle, Reynolds number, viscosity, pressure).
* Materials: Material science properties (Stress, Strain, Hooke's Law, Young's modulus, thermal expansion).
* Relativity: Einstein tensors, geodesic deviation, spacetime intervals.
* Thermodynamics: Heat diffusion, entropy, partition functions.

The DeepCausality project provides a [rich set of code examples](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality/tree/main/examples) for a variety of use cases:

* Classical Causal inference, e.g., CATE, DBN, Granger, RCM, SCM
* Multi-physics simulations, e.g., Electromagnetism, GRMHD, Particle Physics, etc.
* Medicine, e.g., Protein Folding, MRI Tissue Classification, etc.
* Material science, e.g., Metamaterials, Topological Insulator, etc.
* Avionics: MagNav, Geometric TCAS, etc.

The [DeepCausality project invites](https://deepcausality.com/community/), physicists engineers, and scientific computing experts from all fields of science and technology to collaborate with us on advancing Rust for scientific computing. The DeepCausality [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Bxj9P7JXSj) is 
the best place to get started.
