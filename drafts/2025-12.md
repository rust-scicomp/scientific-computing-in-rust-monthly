# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #13

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

<!-- Editor can write a 2-3 sentence introduction here -->

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online
at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy
at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed
at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items

## Crate of the month: CRATE-NAME

<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.
If you'd like to suggest a crate that we could include here, tell us on the rust-scicomp Zulip chat
(https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/login/).

## New releases

<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->

### [DeepCausality 0.12](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality)

DeepCausality started out as a project in advanced computational causality for static and dynamic multimodal causal models, but its most recent release contains [a new foundation](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-causal-monad/) that comes combined with [multiple unified math libraries](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-uniform-math/) for:

* Geometric Algebra
* Differential Topology
* Sparse Matrix representation
* Tensor Operations including ein_sum

Geometry, topology, sparse matrices, and tensor operations seamlessly compose with each other and thus form the foundation of the [new physics crate](https://deepcausality.com/blog/announcement-physics-crate/), a pure Rust implementation of physics formulas across different fields, such as:

* Astrophysics: Astrophysics kernels (Schwarzschild radius, orbital velocity, luminosity, Hubble's law, etc.).
* Dynamics: Classical mechanics (Kinematics, Newton's laws), state estimation (Kalman filters), and Euler integration.
* Electromagnetism: Maxwell's equations, Lorentz force, Poynting vectors, and gauge fields using Geometric Algebra.
* Fluids: Fluid dynamics (Bernoulli's principle, Reynolds number, viscosity, pressure).
* Materials: Material science properties (Stress, Strain, Hooke's Law, Young's modulus, thermal expansion).
* Relativity: Einstein tensors, geodesic deviation, spacetime intervals.
* Thermodynamics: Heat diffusion, entropy, partition functions.

The DeepCausality project provides a [rich set of code examples](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality/tree/main/examples) for a variety of use cases:

* Classical Causal inference, e.g., CATE, DBN, Granger, RCM, SCM
* Multi-physics simulations, e.g., Electromagnetism, GRMHD, Particle Physics, etc.
* Medicine, e.g., Protein Folding, MRI Tissue Classification, etc.
* Material science, e.g., Metamaterials, Topological Insulator, etc.
* Avionics: MagNav, Geometric TCAS, etc.

The [DeepCausality project invites](https://deepcausality.com/community/), physicists engineers, and scientific computing experts from all fields of science and technology to collaborate with us on advancing Rust for scientific computing. The DeepCausality [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Bxj9P7JXSj) is 
the best place to get started.
