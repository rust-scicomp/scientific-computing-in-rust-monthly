### [spindalis](https://github.com/lignum-vitae/spindalis)

Spindalis is a bioinformatics-focused library for numerical modeling, optimisation, data analysis, and simulation written. This library is still in early-stage development but is intended to make working with algorithms commonly used in bioinformatics (and other areas) as simple to use as possible.

There are issues posted for the next items to be added to the library. If you're interested in helping, don't hesitate to check out the repository! Any help, ideas, or questions are welcome!

## Miscellaneous
<!--
